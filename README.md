## Usage
Select a group of connected nodes, switch to Extrude (`x` on the keyboard), click, and drag to the left or right to extrude the nodes inward or outward. The angle at which the nodes are extruded is equal to the angle of the perpendicular of the line that connects the first and last nodes in a selection.
